            <h2 class="card-title">Skins UK</h2>
            <p class="card-text">Skins is a British teen comedy-drama television series that follows the lives of a group of teenagers in Bristol, South West England, through the two years of sixth form. Its controversial story-lines have explored issues like dysfunctional families, mental illness (such as depression, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder), adolescent sexuality, gender, substance abuse, Autism spectrum disorder, death, and bullying.

Each episode generally focuses on a particular character and the struggles he or she faces in his or her life and the episodes are named after the featured character. The show was created by father-and-son television writers Bryan Elsley and Jamie Brittain for Company Pictures,[1] and premiered on E4 on 25 January 2007.[2] Skins went on to be a critical success as well as a ratings winner.

Over its initial six-year run, Skins proved to be atypical of ongoing drama series in that it replaced its primary cast every two years. Plans for a film spin-off were first discussed in 2009, but ultimately did not come to fruition. Instead, a specially-commissioned seventh and final series of the show was broadcast in 2013, featuring some of the cast from its 2007–2010 run.[3] The show's name comes from the cigarette rolling papers known as "skins".[citation needed]

Other ventures to expand the brand have included a short-lived North American remake, which aired on MTV in 2011, but was cancelled after one season after advertisers abandoned the series in response to low ratings and the significant controversy which arose over its depiction of teen sexuality.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Skins: How the TV series produced so much British talent</h2>
            <p class="card-text">Kaya Scodelario was one of the longest-serving members of the cast, appearing in series one to four as Effy Stonem.

She went on to appear in sci-fi thriller Maze Runner and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales alongside Johnny Depp.</p>


<p>Nicholas Hoult was the only member of the main cast who had serious acting experience before the show.

He'd starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant in 2002.

Nicholas has since gone on to play Beast in three X-Men prequels as well as roles in the Mad Max remake and a Kill Your Friends movie adaptation.</p>


<p>Jack O'Connell, who played Cook in series three and four, was hand-picked by Angelina Jolie to star in her 2014 movie Unbroken.

The 27-year-old also picked up the Rising Star award at the 2015 Baftas and starred alongside Sienna Miller in the West End play A Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.</p>

<p>Fans of Game of Thrones will be familiar with Joe Dempsie and Hannah Murray who play Gendry and Gilly respectively.</p>

<p>And Olly Alexander, who played photographer Jakob in the final series of the show, is now the frontman of Years & Years.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">A Show Written for the Young by the Young</h2>
            <p class="card-text">BRYAN ELSLEY recalls the humbling conversation in 2005 that inspired “Skins,” the popular and provocative British series he helped create that will have its American premiere Sunday night on BBC America. He was preparing for a pitch meeting and decided to run his concepts for TV shows — a global warming drama, a political corruption thriller — past his 20-year-old son, Jamie Brittain.</p>

<p>Words were not minced. “He said: ‘These are all boring, middle-aged ideas for boring, middle-aged television executives. Why can’t you think of something with a little bit more oomph?,’ ” Mr. Elsley said. When Dad challenged Son to come up with a better alternative, Mr. Brittain cited the morally oppressive, unfun nature of most adolescent-oriented shows on television. “He said that being a teenager, by definition, means behaving badly, having sex, flirting with drink and drugs,” Mr. Elsley said, and all teenage dramas either pretend such things don’t happen or make sure that if they do, “people die as a consequence.”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘Why don’t you do a teen show that just for once really has some edge?’ ” Mr. Elsley said.</p>

<p>And so “Skins” was conceived, a comedy-drama series set in Bristol, England, about a group of eight close friends who love to congregate at parent-free flats to drink, get high, dance, listen to blaring music, hook up (or at least obsess about it), bicker, forgive and curse like sailors. Five minutes into the first episode Tony (Nicholas Hoult), the gang’s cheekbone-rich, swaggering leader, begins working his cellphone with the dexterity of a high-paid events organizer as he arranges for his bespectacled, unsure sidekick, Sid (Mike Bailey), to lose his virginity.</p>

<p> watching Generation Skins noisily get their party on isn’t the real motor of the series. What reflects the human-size soap opera that is the life of a real teenager are all the casually stinging asides, the surge and abrupt decline of social power, the unforgivable betrayals and gnawing insecurities that the kids experience..</p>
