            <h2 class="card-title">Riverdale</h2>
            <p class="card-text">Riverdale is an American teen drama television series based on the characters of Archie Comics. The series was adapted for The CW by Archie Comics' chief creative officer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, and is produced by Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios, in association with Berlanti Productions and Archie Comics. Originally conceived as a feature film adaptation for Warner Bros. Pictures, the idea was re-imagined as a television series for Fox. In 2015, development on the project moved to The CW, where the series was ordered for a pilot. Filming takes place in Vancouver, British Columbia.

The series features an ensemble cast based on the characters of Archie Comics, with KJ Apa in the role of Archie Andrews; Lili Reinhart as Betty Cooper, Camila Mendes as Veronica Lodge, and Cole Sprouse as Jughead Jones, the series' narrator. The cast also features Madelaine Petsch as Cheryl Blossom, Ashleigh Murray as Josie McCoy, Casey Cott as Kevin Keller, Charles Melton and Ross Butler as Reggie Mantle, and Vanessa Morgan as Toni Topaz. Other characters in the series include the parents of the main characters: Luke Perry as Fred Andrews, Mädchen Amick as Alice Cooper, Marisol Nichols and Mark Consuelos as Hermione and Hiram Lodge, and Skeet Ulrich as FP Jones.

The series debuted on January 26, 2017, to positive reviews. In January 2019, The CW renewed the series for a fourth season, later to be revealed of 22 episodes. The fourth season is set to premiere on October 9, 2019.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The tweet comes after showrunner Roberto Aguirre Sacasa posted a series of images on Twitter teasing the show’s return, spelling out the caption: “Posted. Without. Comment.”

<p>One shot was split by text and a shot of another show, reading: “Wednesday October 9, The CW.”

The tweet was quick to excite fans, suggesting the US release date could be as soon as three months time.

However, Lili’s announcement got mixed reactions from viewers as some fans couldn’t wait for more action while others were sceptical of previous storylines.</p>

<p>One user commented: “Yay!! Good luck! We know you’re going to kill it!”</p>

<p>A second replied: “Cannot believe we have to wait till October for season fourrr, buttt it’s exciting they start filming in a few days. here’s to a summer break full of rewatching riverdale.”</p>

            <p class="card-text">Speaking to Mashable, he spoke about season two’s iconic drag race scene.</p>

<p>The scene in question sees Jughead Jones (played by Cole Sprouse) racing against a member of the Ghoulies amid the ongoing Jingle Jangle outbreak.

Brendan spoke about how he made these shots so distinctive, and working with Cheryl Blossom star Madelaine Petsch.</p>

<p>He told the publication: “The drag race episode in season two was a tonne of fun to do and there were a tonne of shots that were really hard to pull off.”

He went on: “One of the most powerful shots was Cheryl doing the flags.

“Madelaine’s timing was always impeccable - she walked between the two cars, and she was perfect with the camera. She knows it inside and out.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Archie Andrews to couple up with Sabrina Spellman after hint?</h2>
            <p class="card-text">Throughout Riverdale’s three seasons so far Archie Andrews (played by KJ Apa) has enjoyed a number of relationships and flings with some different characters.
            Likewise, Sabrina Spellman (Kiernan Shipka) has struggled to decide between her two potential love interests, leaving her feeling a little confused throughout the episodes.

But could the duo eventually partner up and develop a wonderful romance together?</p>

<p>Archie Comics’ official Twitter account recently posted a new front cover from an upcoming five-part series called “Archie and Sabrina.”

Sabrina can be seen sporting a Riverdale varsity jacket which reads “Andrews” across the back, while Archie stands next to her.

The tweet reads: “Archie and Sabrina are dating (in the comics).

“Please check it out when it comes out (at a comic book store) on July 24th. (It's a comic book).”</p>

<p>While it looks like the franchise is adamant about the crossover being confined to the comic book, it may be a double bluff.

Greendale and Riverdale have been mentioned in tandem in each TV show, so the possibility of them crossing over certainly exists.

Hopefully fans just have to wait around long enough to see Archie and Sabrina get together.

Meanwhile, Riverdale’s director of photography, Brendan Uegama recently spoke to Mashable about the iconic season two scene involving Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch) and a drag race.</p>
