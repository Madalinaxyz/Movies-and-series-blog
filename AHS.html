            <h2 class="card-title">AHS</h2>
            <p class="card-text">American Horror Story (sometimes abbreviated as AHS) is an American anthology horror television series created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk for the basic cable network FX. Each season is conceived as a self-contained miniseries, following a different set of characters and settings, and a storyline with its own "beginning, middle, and end." Some plot elements of each season are loosely inspired by true events.[3][4][5]

The first season, retroactively subtitled Murder House, takes place in Los Angeles, California, during the year 2011, and centers on a family that moves into a house haunted by its deceased former occupants. The second season, subtitled Asylum, takes place in Massachusetts during the year 1964, and follows the stories of the patients and staff of an institution for the criminally insane. The third season, subtitled Coven, takes place in New Orleans, Louisiana, during the year 2013, and follows a coven of witches who face off against those who wish to destroy them. The fourth season, subtitled Freak Show, takes place in Jupiter, Florida, during the year 1952, and centers around one of the last remaining American freak shows and their struggle for survival. The fifth season, subtitled Hotel, takes place in Los Angeles, California, during the year 2015, and focuses on the staff and guests of a supernatural hotel. The sixth season, subtitled Roanoke, takes place in North Carolina during the years 2014–2016, and focuses on the paranormal events that take place at an isolated farmhouse haunted by the deceased Roanoke colony. The seventh season, subtitled Cult, takes place in the fictional suburb of Brookfield Heights, Michigan, during the year 2017, and centers on a cult terrorizing the residents in the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The eighth season, subtitled Apocalypse features the return of the witches from Coven as they battle the Antichrist from Murder House, and attempt to prevent the apocalypse. The upcoming ninth season, subtitled 1984, is set to premiere on September 18, 2019.

The series is broadcast on the cable television channel FX in the United States. On January 12, 2017, the series was renewed for a ninth season, with a two-season renewal alongside Apocalypse. On August 3, 2018, the series was greenlit for a tenth season.[6] American Horror Story is a joint production between Ryan Murphy Productions, Brad Falchuk Teley-Vision, and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television.

Although reception to individual seasons has varied, American Horror Story largely has been well received by television critics, with the majority of the praise going towards the cast, particularly Jessica Lange, who won two Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performances. Kathy Bates and James Cromwell each won an Emmy Award for their performances, while Lady Gaga won a Golden Globe Award. The series draws consistently high ratings for the FX network, with its first season being the most-viewed new cable series of 2011.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">No Sarah Paulson in American Horror Story: 1984?</h2>
            <p class="card-text">American Horror Story: 1984 could be down not one, but two mainstay stars. Variety reports Sarah Paulson will join Evan Peters and sit out the upcoming ninth season of Ryan Murphy's hit FX anthology series.</p>

<p>Details about the new season are scarce—after all, it is American Horror Story—but a teaser invokes slasher flick vibes and indicates it'll take place at a summer camp in 1984. Murphy previously announced Emma Roberts and Gus Kenworthy would star and play a couple.</p>

<p>Paulson has appeared in every season of American Horror Story since it began in 2011.
In season eight, American Horror Story: Apocalypse, Paulson took on not one, but three different characters and even stepped behind the scenes to make her directorial debut. Variety reports Paulson could appear in a cameo, but as of now she's not slated to have a major role. Peters, another AHS veteran who has appeared since the start, previously indicated he would be taking a break from the franchise.</p>

<p>Aside from Roberts and Kenworthy, the rest of the AHS: 1984 cast is still a mysterious. AHS: Apocalypse, which was a crossover season between AHS: Murder House and AHS: Coven, featured appearances by many series veterans and a few newcomers including Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, Billie Lourd, Dylan McDermott, Taissa Farmiga, Joan Collins, Adina Porter, Connie Britton, Billy Porter, Billy Eichner, Lily Rabe, Stevie Nicks and Angela Bassett.</p>

<p>Paulson won't be gone from TV screens for long. She's set to appear opposite Cate Blanchett in Mrs. America, a new FX series, and has been attached to Murphy's Netflix series Ratched, a prequel to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.</p>

<p>Request for comment from FX was not immediately returned.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Season 6 spoilers</h2>
            <p class="card-text">Dang it, nerds!</p>

<p>American Horror Story: Apocalypse has been slowly shedding some light on exactly how the apocalypse came to be, and a few things made a whole lot of sense this week. After last week's strange and somewhat less-than-exciting episode saw Michael (Cody Fern) getting himself a new Kathy Bates from two nerdy engineers (Billy Eichner and Evan Peters in the worst wigs of all time) who build life-like female robots, this week showed us that the nerds could also control the robot. That meant that they could use it to put ideas into Michael's head—ideas like "he should go back to the nerds and listen to them." </p>

<p>So he did, and they introduced him to "The Cooperative," also known as the Illuminati (LOL), and explained to him that as the Antichrist, he controlled the Cooperative, and he could end the world and destroy the witches. He then went to the Cooperative, made up of a whole bunch of masked rich people, and informed them that they and their families would be safe in a series of outposts, which they were also going to help build.</p>

<p>Later, the nerds explained to their secretary, Ms. Venable, that they were going to build some outposts, and she could run one and make up all her own rules for the people inside it. So we have two genius idiots to thank for all this, which is typical. </p>
