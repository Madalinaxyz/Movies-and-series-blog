        <h2>Hannah Murray</h2>
        <p>Tegan Lauren-Hannah Murray (born 1 July 1989) is an English actress best known for portraying Cassie Ainsworth in the E4 teen drama series Skins (2007–2008; 2013), for which she was the recipient of a BAFTA Audience Award, and Gilly in the HBO series Game of Thrones (2012–2019), for which she has been nominated along with her castmates for two Screen Actors Guild Awards as ensemble players. She has received praise for her performances in the Off West End play Martine (2014) and the film Bridgend.
          At the age of 17, Murray heard about an audition for young actors in Bristol, and decided to audition for the experience. The auditions were for the E4 teen drama series Skins. She impressed the producers of the series and was cast as Cassie Ainsworth, a gentle and creative but self-destructive teenager with an eating disorder. Murray and April Pearson were the first two to be cast on the show.[4] Murray went on to appear in the first two series, from 2007 to 2008. She left at the end of the show's second series to make way for a new generation of characters. On the decision to replace the cast, Murray has said that "it would be really silly to be in a teenage drama if you're no longer a teenager".[5]</p>

<p>Following Skins in May 2008, Murray made her stage debut as Mia in the critically acclaimed That Face, a West End production at the Duke of York's Theatre. She was highly praised for her acting in the play, and it was considered a milestone in her career as she abandoned her well-known "Cassie way".[6] That same year, she had a small role in the black comedy In Bruges, but her scene was cut from the film.[7]</p>

<p>On 8 August 2011, HBO confirmed that Murray would portray Gilly in the second and third seasons of Game of Thrones. She was upgraded to a series regular for the fourth season. Her character is a young woman who has a baby by her own father, and becomes protected by the character Samwell Tarly.[9] In 2012, she appeared in the action thriller film The Numbers Station.</p>

<p>In 2013, Murray appeared in a two-episode feature, in the seventh and final series of Skins, where she reprised her role as a more serious, solemn, and independent adult Cassie Ainsworth.[10] She also starred in the music video for "Your Cover's Blown" by Belle & Sebastian.[11]</p>

<p>In 2014, Murray starred in God Help the Girl, about three musicians in Glasgow. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2014, and Murray shared the World Cinema Dramatic Special Jury Award for the Delightful Ensemble Performance. Later that year she continued her role as Gilly in Game of Thrones season 4. She also starred in the acclaimed revival of Jean-Jacques Bernard’s play Martine, playing the title role. Her performance was considered one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking of the year by the public and critics, and she was nominated for Best Female Performance at the Off West End Awards.[12]</p>
<p>Murray starred in Lily & Kat (2015), an independent American film and the first feature directed by Micael Preysler, about inseparable best friends who struggle to make the best of their last few days together, savouring the city nightlife with an enigmatic artist one of them takes a liking to.</p>

<p>In 2015 she played Sara in the Danish film Bridgend, based on the Bridgend suicides of South Wales. The film premiered at the Rotterdam Film Festival, and received great reviews. The film then had its North American premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival where it won 3 awards, including Murray for Best Actress.</p>

<p>In 2016 Murray played Sylvia Ageloff, a young Jewish American intellectual from Brooklyn and a confidante of Trotsky, in the film The Chosen</p>

        <h2>Cole Sprouse</h2>
        <p>Cole Mitchell Sprouse (born August 4, 1992)[1] is an American actor. He is the twin brother of Dylan Sprouse, and is known for his role as Cody Martin on the Disney Channel series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and its spinoff The Suite Life on Deck. As of 2017, Sprouse stars as Jughead Jones on The CW television series Riverdale.</p>
        <p>Cole Mitchell Sprouse was born in Arezzo, Italy, to American parents Matthew Sprouse and Melanie Wright, while they were teaching at an English language school in Tuscany.[2] Cole was born 15 minutes after his older twin brother Dylan Sprouse.[3] Cole was named after jazz singer and pianist Nat King Cole.[4][5] Four months after his birth, the family moved back to their parents' native Long Beach, California.[6]</p>
        <p>Cole and his brother, Dylan, began acting at the age of eight months following a suggestion from their grandmother, Jonine Booth Wright, who was a drama teacher and actress.[7] Much of Sprouse's early career was shared with his brother—some of their earliest roles were shared roles as one baby or child in commercials, television shows, and films.[8][9] Due to child labor laws in California restricting the amount of time children can be filmed in a day, casting twins in a single role allows more time for one character to be filmed.[10] Some notable roles he shared with his brother include the characters of Patrick Kelly in the sitcom Grace Under Fire from 1993 to 1998, Julian in the 1999 film, Big Daddy, and young Pistachio Disguisey in 2002's The Master of Disguise.[9][11][12] In 2001, Cole began appearing in episodes of NBC's television sitcom Friends, as Ross Geller's son, Ben; this role was his first role in which he did not appear with his brother.[11][13] As he and his brother grew older, they began taking on more roles as separate characters but often still worked on the same projects. Their first role as separate characters in the same production was as kids in a MADtv sketch.[14] Sprouse portrayed Cody Martin in the 2005 Disney Channel original series, The Suite Life of Zack and Cody alongside his brother; he reprised the role in the show's 2008 spinoff, The Suite Life on Deck and its related film.[9][15]

</p>
<p>Sprouse is a fan of comics and worked at the Los Angeles comic store Meltdown.[18]

Sprouse began attending New York University in 2011, after deferring one year.[19] Initially interested in studying film and television production, he decided to enroll instead in the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, pursuing the humanities and in particular archaeology.[20] He graduated alongside his brother in May 2015.[21] Sprouse worked briefly in the field of archaeology, participating in excavations and performing lab work. He specialized in geographical information systems and satellite imaging.[22][23] During his studies he performed summer digs in both Europe and Asia. Among his undergraduate work, he unearthed a mask of Dionysus on a dig in Bulgaria.[24]

Sprouse has an avid interest in photography. In 2011, he launched a personal photography website and took classes at NYU.[25][20] He has had shoot assignments for major fashion publications including Teen Vogue, L'Uomo Vogue, The Sunday Times Style, and W Magazine, among others.[26][27][28][29]
